description: Capture idea or task as todo from current conversation context
---


<objective>
Capture an idea, task, or issue that surfaces during a GSD session as a structured todo for later work.

Routes to the add-todo workflow which handles:
- Directory structure creation
- Content extraction from arguments or conversation
- Area inference from file paths
- Duplicate detection and resolution
- Todo file creation with frontmatter
- STATE.md updates
- Git commits
</objective>

<execution_context>
@.agent/get-shit-done/workflows/add-todo.md
</execution_context>

<context>
Arguments: $ARGUMENTS (optional todo description)

State is resolved in-workflow via `init todos` and targeted reads.
</context>

<process>
**Follow the add-todo workflow** from `@.agent/get-shit-done/workflows/add-todo.md`.

The workflow handles all logic including:
1. Directory ensuring
2. Existing area checking
3. Content extraction (arguments or conversation)
4. Area inference
5. Duplicate checking
6. File creation with slug generation
7. STATE.md updates
8. Git commits
</process>

<success_criteria>
- [ ] The core objective stated in the context or workflow was perfectly achieved.
- [ ] Required output files or state updates are correctly written to disk.
- [ ] Operations are atomic and accurately logged.
</success_criteria>

<failure_modes>
- Required input files (context, state, plans) may be missing or empty.
- Tools may fail due to incorrect parameters or unexpected system states.
- Agent may hallucinate completion without verifying final file contents.
</failure_modes>
